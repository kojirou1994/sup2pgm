SUP2PGM
Converts BluRay presentation graphics streams (SUP subtitles) to PGM images
one can later transcode or OCR into text.


sup2pgm is designed to mimic the behaviour of subtitle2pgm from transcode
suite (http://tcforge.berlios.de/).  It reads the SUP stream, dumps subtitle
images to PGM files and saves timecodes to an SRT file.

Usage:  sup2pgm [options]
Options:
    -i <file_name>  Use file_name for input (default: stdin).
    -o <base_name>  Use base_name for output files (default: movie_subtitle).


Thanks to 0xdeadbeef for BDSup2Sub I've ripped most of the code from.
