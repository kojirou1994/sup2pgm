SUP2PGM
Converts a SUP (BluRay) subtitle stream to PGM images.


sup2pgm is made to mimic subtitle2pgm (from transcode suite, see
http://tcforge.berlios.de/) behaviour: it reads the .SUP stream, dumps
caption images to PGM files and saves timing to a .SRTX file.

Usage:  sup2pgm [options]
Options:
    -i <file_name>  Use file_name for input (default: stdin).
    -o <base_name>  Use base_name for output files (default: movie_subtitle).
